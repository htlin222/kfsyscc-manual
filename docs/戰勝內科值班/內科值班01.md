## Fever

- Duty的發燒 ≠ 不明原因發燒（如果經調查後沒有找到原因，則稱為不明原因發燒），應當視為感染；敗血症需要廣效抗生素治療。
- 致命的原因
    - 敗血症（CRBSI、CDI）、發熱性中性粒細胞減少症、中樞神經系統感染
        - 病史、體格檢查和實驗室檢查
        - 生命體徵+全身檢查；SOFA+乳酸、血液培養x2、尿液分析、胸部X光、± C. difficile 毒素；排除中樞神經系統感染；在肝硬化病人中，需考慮自發性細菌性腹膜炎(spontaneous bacterial peritonitis)。
- 管理
    - 如果懷疑敗血症，應在第一個小時內給予廣效抗生素；如果出現敗血性休克，應給予血管活性藥物和液體。
    - 確定感染的來源並進行來源控制
    - 考慮使用Curam或Fortum → Tazocin → Mero ± Teico ± Fluconazle
    -  Cover pseudomonas in febrile neutropenia



## Shock

### I. Tissue hypoperfusion
   - The key factor to consider is the blood pressure (BP), which is equal to cardiac output (CO) multiplied by systemic vascular resistance (SVR).
   - Echocardiography (FALLS) can be useful in diagnosing this condition.

### II. Lethal etiology
   - Allergic reactions
   - Sepsis
   - Bleeding
   - Pulmonary embolism
   - Cardiac tamponade
   - Acute coronary syndrome
   - Arrhythmias

### III. History, physical examination, and laboratory tests
   - Ask about medications, heart rate, temperature, dry or wet cough, and basal rales.
   - Blood tests such as complete blood count (CBC), basic coagulation studies (BCS), and lactate/troponin I levels may be useful.
   - Imaging studies such as inferior vena cava (IVC) assessment, pleural effusion evaluation, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and right ventricular assessment can also be performed.

### IV. Management
   - Maintain vital signs and provide intravenous fluids and oxygen while monitoring the patient.
   - A 500 ml normal saline (N/S) bolus is recommended in all cases.
   - In cases of hemorrhagic shock, 18-gauge intravenous catheters should be inserted into both arms, and whole blood should be given while monitoring heart rate.
   - In cases of anaphylactic shock, epinephrine (0.5 mg) should be given intramuscularly.
   - In septic shock, vasopressors should be considered.

## Altered mental status

- Altered Mental Status
    - Altered mental status is a medical condition characterized by changes in mental function, such as confusion, disorientation, and agitation.
    - Vital signs including sugar levels, metabolic status, and a CT scan should be checked immediately. In cases of stroke, time is of the essence as every minute counts.

- Lethal Etiology
    - Hypoglycemia
    - Decreased oxygen levels (O2↓) and increased carbon dioxide levels (CO2↑)
    - Stroke
    - Increased calcium or potassium levels (Ca/K↑)
    - CNS infections
    - Sepsis

- History, Physical Examination, and Laboratory Tests
    - History, physical examination, and laboratory tests should be performed, including asking about trauma, drug use, progression of symptoms, and the possibility of CNS infection.
    - Neurological examination (dolleye) is also essential.
    - Blood tests such as a full metabolic panel, arterial blood gas (ABG), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), ammonia, and basic coagulation studies (e-BCS) may be useful.
    - Urinary tract infection (UTI) could also be a cause of altered mental status.

- Management
    - Management of altered mental status involves ensuring airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) while monitoring vital signs.
    - The patient should be treated according to the underlying cause.
    - Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), pupil examination, and muscle strength should be followed up.
    - A CT scan and consultation with a neurologist may be necessary.
    - In cases of seizure, Ativan and Keppra may be administered.
    - An MRI and dexamethasone may be necessary if malignancy or brain metastases are suspected.
## Dyspnea
- Keep Vitals and Look out for Signs of Failure
    - It is essential to keep vital signs such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure and look out for signs of failure.
    - Altered mental status is a common symptom that can indicate a medical emergency, and an echocardiogram (BLUE protocol) may be helpful in diagnosing the condition.

- Lethal Etiology
    - Several conditions can lead to altered mental status, including:
        - Pneumonia
        - Cardiac tamponade
        - Pneumothorax
        - Atypical acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
        - Pulmonary embolism (PE)
        - Increased carbon dioxide levels (CO2↑) and decreased oxygen levels (O2↓) in conditions such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

- History, Physical Examination, and Laboratory Tests
    - A history and physical examination should be conducted, including assessing sputum, chest pain, jugular vein distention, rales, and edema. An electrocardiogram (EKG) and troponin I (TnI) levels can also be helpful.
    - Chest X-ray, arterial blood gas (ABG), complete blood count (CBC)/basic coagulation studies (BCS), and follow-up EKG may be useful.
    - An echocardiogram using the BLUE protocol may be necessary.

- Management
    - ABC (airway, breathing, and circulation) should be ensured while monitoring the patient's vital signs.
    - The patient should be treated according to the underlying cause. 
    - Oxygen supplementation can be helpful, and bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) can be used for CHF and COPD patients.
    - Intubation may be necessary if indicated (except for PE).

   
## Chest pain
> 心電圖 (STEMI equivalent) 必須要做！心臟超音波有助於診斷！

- 致命病因
  - 急性冠狀動脈綜合症 (ACS)、肺栓塞、主動脈夾層擴張及心包積液、氣胸
- 病史、體檢及實驗室
  - LQQOPERA、頸靜脈檢查、啞鈴音、脈搏壓（收縮壓-舒張壓）
  - 心電圖 + 心肌肌酸激酶 (TnI) + 胸部X光；超音波：胸腔/腹部主動脈
- 治療
  - 適當治療；懷疑ACS則諮詢心血管科
  - 不確定情況下可追蹤心電圖/心肌肌酸激酶 (TnI)、根據風險驗D-dimer或進行CT掃描
  - 心臟超音波可幫助診斷
- 最後的招數：三重CT血管攝影排除肺栓塞+心肌梗塞+主動脈夾層擴張

## Abdominal pain

> 排除急性腹痛和缺血性腸病；進行心臟超音波檢查

- 致命病因
  - 急性胃潰瘍穿孔 (PPU)、缺血性腸病、腹主動脈瘤 (AAA)、主動脈夾層擴張、腸道梗阻、糖尿病酮症酸中毒 (DKA)
- 病史、體檢及實驗室
  - LQQOPERA (是否突然？是否急性？)、生命體徵、腹部體格檢查；乳酸、完整血液計數/基本代謝面板/血糖/血液凝固功能檢查、脂肪酶、懷孕情況？；超音波：腹部主動脈
- 治療
  - 確定病因最為重要，但還是可以給予止痛和禁食。
  - 如果懷疑感染 → 廣譜抗生素（但要注意掩蓋病灶）
  - 40歲以上的上腹痛患者要記得進行心電圖檢查。
  - 急性腹痛 → 考慮外科手術。如果不確定，則進行CT血管攝影（CTA）+  arterial phase 動脈相位。
